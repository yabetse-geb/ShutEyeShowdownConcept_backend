First, every action in my SleepSchedule concept accepted a composite object of either Time or Date. This could be problematic because they are both mutable objects so if a reference is attached to the argument passed in, the state of the concept could be mutated. Therefore, I have changed these so that they will be passed in as strings and internally be handled with Date objects. Additionally, I changed what is considered a successful adherence to a users set wake up time set. Initially, the concept was set up so that in reportWakeUpTime if the user passes in a time that is before their established wake up time it counted as a success. But I realized that this doesn't make much sense as waking up earlier when not intended to is not the best sleep habit, so I changed it so that a success is only when the passed in report time is within 5 minutes of the established wake up time. I also, took careful consideration when thinking about the case in which a user sleeps after midnight. To do this I needed to change how I stored time in my states to now using Date objects instead of Time objects with just the hour and minute (in 24 hour clock). This was to fix this issue in this scenario: a user says that on 10/13/2025 they should sleep at 23:00, but they slept at 00:15 on 10/14/2025. Initially I would have seen this as a success since 00:15 < 23:00 but now that I will associate dates with time it allows me the concept to recognize that 00:15 on 10/14/2025 is past 23:00 on 10/13/25.
