# concept: Sessioning [User, Session]

*   **purpose**: To maintain a user's logged-in state across multiple requests without re-sending credentials.
*   **principle**: After a user is authenticated, a session is created for them. Subsequent requests using that session's ID are treated as being performed by that user, until the session is deleted (logout).
*   **state**:
    *   a set of `Session`s with
        *   a `user` User
*   **actions**:
    *   `create (user: User): (session: Session)`
        *   **requires**: true.
        *   **effects**: creates a new Session `s`; associates it with the given `user`; returns `s` as `session`.
    *   `delete (session: Session): ()`
        *   **requires**: the given `session` exists.
        *   **effects**: removes the session `s`.
*   **queries**:
    *   `_getUser (session: Session): (user: User)`
        *   **requires**: the given `session` exists.
        *   **effects**: returns the user associated with the session.
