# Concept: PasswordAuth
- **concept**: PasswordAuth
- **purpose**: limit access to known users and establish point of contact.
- **principle**:  after a user registers with username, password, and establishes an email they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated as the same user. Can also be contacted with the provided email address. Users can also change their password or email. Lastly users can "deactivate/delete their account".
- **invariant:**
	- no User has the same username
- **state**:
    - A set of Users with
        - a `username`: String
        - an `email`:String
    - A set of Credentials
        - a `username`: String
        - an email:String
        - a user:User
- **actions**:
    - `register(username:String, password:String, email:String): (user:User)`
        - **requires**: no user exists with username and no credential exists with username
        - **effects**: creates and returns a new User with username and email
    - authenticate(username: String, password: String): (user:User)
        - **requires**: there exists a Credential with username and password
        - **effects**: returns the corressponding user
    - changePassword(username:String, currentPassword:String, newPassword:String)
        - **requires**: there exists a Credential c with username and password 
        - **effects**: sets the password for the User of Credential c to newPassword
    - changeEmail(username:String, password:String, newPassword:String, newEmail:String)
        - **requires**: there exists a Credential c with username and password 
        - **effects**: sets the email for the User of Credential c to newPassword
    - deactivateAccount(username:String, password:String):
	    -  **requires**: there exists a Credential c with username and password 
        - **effects**: remove the Credential with username and removes the User with username
