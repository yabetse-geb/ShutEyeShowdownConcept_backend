This project had some very enjoyable moments while also having a lot of difficult and stressful moments. 


## Difficulties and mistakes:

* What I found difficult and slightly annoying was how iteration felt discouraging initially as I felt like implementing small changes required a lot of effort. 
	* The effort came from having to change the concept spec, along with the concept code, and then the concept test cases, along with the api specs, and then finally the front end. 
	* This feeling of needing to change so much for little changes made my innovation feel like a punishment at times when I was first getting used to iterating. I noticed that at random moments I would find ways to improve the idea of my app as I envisioned being the user, for instance how I changed the way scoring work to prevent users from feeling discouraged to report their failures. And these ideas were great and I found it easy to find improvements, but then iterating on my app felt difficult until I got used to iteration and using LLMs to ease the process as well. 
* A mistake that I made that made this project difficult at times, was being inconsistent with how I handled date objects in my different concepts. What I came to learn was that when storing date objects in MongoDB they always get translated to UTC time zone, and this made my inconsistent handling of dates between my concepts much more difficult to deal with. 
	* Reflection for next time: So, next time I would make sure to remember that though my concepts may work well individually, it is important to have consistent practices so that when it is time to sync them together, they harmonize and don't lead to difficult debugging. 
* Difficulties with AI:
	* Many times while working with my agentic coding tool, Cursor, I felt like it was very stubborn. As, when I suggested possible fixes it would steer away from those ideas at times and try creating additional changes to get its initial, incorrect idea to work
## What went well/was easy:
* I really enjoyed using Cursor for the front end, I found it very easy to be able to prompt cursor to bring what I had in mind into life
* It was also very good at taking context from what I changed in the backend and then modifying the front end to work well with the updates
* I feel much more confident in my ability to vibe code, as over time I was able to incorporate pretty significant changes within a short period of time especially relative to how long it would have taken with out the use of an agentic coding tool
* I felt as though using an LLM allowed me to feel less restricted by what I could accomplish and more ambitious in my expectations for my app

## Further thoughts on AI
* While working on this project I felt that using an LLM made software development a much more enjoyable experience. I felt as though there was a greater emphasis on less restricted design choices (as the LLM helped bring difficult to implement ideas to life), and there was more room for innovation
* Without an LLM tool I feel like I would spend a very large amount of time debugging instead of iterating and improving the behavior and look of my project 
* I feel like the role of LLMs in software development is to allow developers to spend their brain energy and time on more important things like user experience and innovation, instead of worrying about fixing small bugs or understanding verbose syntax. Additionally, it allows for developers to push changes more rapidly and keep up with customers constantly changing demands.
* These conclusions arised from my usage of the Cursor tool which greatly helped me to create the UI (functionality, flow, and appearance), handling how my changes would effect the whole codebase, and I used it to help program syncs. 
	* Additionally the Context tool was great for improving specs, creating initial syncs and implementations
