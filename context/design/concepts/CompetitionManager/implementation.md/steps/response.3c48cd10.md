# response:

You've asked two things:

1. How to make sure your concepts are independent (which I've answered in the previous turn).
2. To implement the `SleepSchedule` concept (which I've provided in the previous turn).
3. To implement the `CompetitionManager` concept.

However, the specification for the `CompetitionManager` concept (its `concept`, `purpose`, `principle`, `state`, and `actions`) has not been provided. I need this specification to implement it following the concept design guidelines.

Please provide the detailed specification for `CompetitionManager` similar to how you provided it for `SleepSchedule`, and I will gladly implement it.
