To ensure concepts are independent, it's crucial to adhere to several design principles:

1. **Strict Separation of State**: Each concept manages its own distinct portion of the application state. While different concepts might refer to the same logical entities (e.g., `User` IDs), they only store the attributes of those entities relevant to their specific purpose. There should be no shared mutable state that one concept can directly read from or write to another concept's internal data model. This prevents implicit dependencies and unexpected side effects.

2. **Generic Type Parameters**: Concepts should be designed using generic type parameters (e.g., `[User, Target, Item]`). These parameters represent opaque identifiers that the concept can store and compare for equality but cannot inspect for internal structure or specific properties. This forces concepts to operate polymorphically, ensuring they don't depend on the concrete types or schemas managed by other concepts.

3. **Well-Defined, Singular Purpose**: Each concept must have a narrow, clearly articulated, and user-centric purpose. This helps to prevent "feature creep" and ensures that a concept doesn't accumulate responsibilities that rightfully belong to other concepts. A focused purpose acts as a boundary, making it easier to reason about the concept in isolation.

4. **Behavioral Completeness**: Within its defined purpose, a concept must be behaviorally complete. It should encapsulate all necessary actions and queries to fulfill its purpose without requiring direct invocation of another concept's internal logic. If interaction with other concerns is needed, it should happen through a higher-level orchestration layer (like a synchronization mechanism) that passes generic identifiers and uses defined action/query interfaces.

5. **Actions as Pre/Post Conditions on Own State**: The `requires` (preconditions) and `effects` (postconditions) for each action must exclusively refer to the concept's own internal state and its generic input/output parameters. They should never mention or attempt to modify the state of another concept. This declarative style reinforces isolation by strictly defining the boundaries of an action's impact.

6. **No Direct Inter-Concept Imports**: At the implementation level, a concept's code should avoid direct import statements that reference other concept implementations. This prevents compile-time and runtime coupling, reinforcing the idea that concepts are independent units.

By diligently applying these principles, concepts become highly decoupled, reusable, and easier to understand, test, and maintain in isolation, which is a core tenet of concept-oriented design.
