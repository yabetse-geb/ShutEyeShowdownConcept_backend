# Concept Implementation

Concepts can be implemented as a single TypeScript class, and must obey the following properties:

1. No import statements can reference another concept in any way, including type declarations.
2. All methods are either actions or queries from the spec: query methods are named beginning with a `_` character.
3. Every action must take a single argument, and output a single argument: both of these are a dictionary/JSON object with primitive values (no custom objects).

For our specific implementation, we will use MongoDB as the database. Each piece of the concept spec is mapped onto the implementation as follows:

* **concept**: the name of the class is {name} + Concept
* **purpose**: the purpose is kept and versioned alongside the code in documentation
* **principle**: the principle helps establish a canonical test and models out desirable behavior
* **state**: the state relations can be mapped directly to the MongoDB collections
* **actions**: each action is a method of the same name, and takes in a dictionary with the keys described by the action parameters in the specification with the specified types
* **queries**: potential queries are also methods, but must begin with an underscore `_`, and instead return an array of the type specified by their return

## Technology stack details

* Make sure that each action/method preserves its **requires**, and performs the specified **effects** in terms of its updates on the MongoDB collection.
* It should be possible to confirm any expectations for what the state looks like when described in **effects** or **principle** using the chosen set of **queries**.
* Use the Deno runtime to minimize setup, and qualified imports such as `import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";`
