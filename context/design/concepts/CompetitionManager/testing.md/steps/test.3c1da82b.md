# test: CompetitionManager making sure to test operational principle and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios here are the 5 additional interesting scenarios I want you to test "1. **Overlapping Competitions Violation** : A user attempts to start a new competition whose date range overlaps with another *active* competition they’re already in. Expected: the system should allow the second `startCompetition`since users can be in multiple active competitions. 2. **Score Update Outside Competition Period** - A user tries to `recordStat` on a date *before* the competition’s start date or *after* its end date. Expected: no score should be updated since the event is out of range, but the system should not crash. 3. Tie Across All Participants at End\*\* Two or more users each have identical total scores when `endCompetition` is called. Expected: `winners` is set to `null`, representing a full tie, and the competition is marked inactive. 4. **Removing Participant to Invalidate Competition** In an active competition with exactly two participants, one user is removed via `removeParticipant`. Expected: the action should fail or deactivate the competition (depending on the implementation variant) to maintain viability. 5. **Repeated or Conflicting Actions** A user repeatedly calls `recordStat` with the same arguments (same user, date, event type, success). Expected: scores continue accumulating correctly without duplication errors, ensuring idempotent and consistent updates." And make sure to put each in their on Deno.test block.
