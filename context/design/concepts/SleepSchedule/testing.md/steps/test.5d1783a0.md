# test: In your latest response you did a great job splitting up the test cases you gave for SleepSchedule into seperate Deno.test cases for each case, now this error "TS2339 \[ERROR]: Property 'u' does not exist on type 'SleepSlot | { error: string; }'." repeatedly occurs so make sure to make a helper function or something to prevent type errors that appear in typescript when running test cases.
