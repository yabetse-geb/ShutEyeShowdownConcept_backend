# implement: update implementation for SleepSchedule concept

Here's the implementation for the `SleepSchedule` concept, following the provided guidelines and addressing the observed ambiguities in the specification.

**Assumptions & Corrections Made During Implementation:**

1. **`addSleepSlot` Parameters:** The original spec had `addSleepSlot (u: User, bedTime:String , wakeTime: String, Time: Number): (survey: Survey)`.
   * I've assumed `Time: Number` was a typo and should have been `dateStr: String`, aligning with other actions that involve a `dateStr`.
   * I've assumed `(survey: Survey)` was a typo for the return type and instead return `{ sleepSlotId: ID }` on success, or `{ error: string }` on failure, to comply with the non-empty return dictionary rule when an error path exists.
2. **`bedTime` and `wakeUpTime` in State:** Renamed to `bedTimeGoal` and `wakeUpTimeGoal` in the `SleepSlot` interface for clarity, as they represent the *target* times set by the user, not the actual reported times.
3. **`wakeUpSuccess` and `bedTimeSuccess` Initialization:** The spec mentioned `Boolean? (null initially)`. For boolean flags representing success, initializing them to `false` is generally more practical than `null` in an implementation where `null` would require explicit checks. I've used `false`.
4. **`reportBedTime` and `reportWakeUpTime` Return Type:** The spec said `Boolean`. I've implemented this as `Promise<{ bedTimeSuccess: boolean } | { error: string }>` and `Promise<{ wakeUpSuccess: boolean } | { error: string }>` respectively, to return a non-empty dictionary on success when an error path is present, as per the "Empty results" rule.
5. **Time/Date Representation and Comparison:** Used `string` for `DateString` (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD") and `TimeString` (e.g., "HH:MM"). The adherence logic (`reportedTime <= bedTimeGoal`, `reportedTime >= wakeUpTimeGoal`) relies on lexicographical string comparison, which works correctly for 24-hour time formats.
6. **`_id` for SleepSlot:** Each `SleepSlot` gets a `freshID()` for its `_id`, as per the "Generic Parameters: managing IDs" section. The combination of `user` and `date` effectively acts as a unique natural key for lookups within a user's schedule.
7. **Added Queries:** Included `_getSleepAdherence` and `_getUserSleepSlots` as examples of queries that would be useful for observing the concept's state.
