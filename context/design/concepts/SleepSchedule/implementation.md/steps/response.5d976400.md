# response:

To ensure concepts are independent, the concept design framework enforces several strict principles:

1. **No Direct Inter-Concept Dependencies:** Concepts are explicitly forbidden from importing or referencing other concepts in any way, including type declarations, within their code implementation. This eliminates compile-time and runtime coupling between concepts, ensuring changes to one concept do not necessitate changes or even knowledge in another.

2. **Generic Type Parameters (Polymorphism by ID):** Concepts are designed to work with generic type parameters (e.g., `[User, Item]`). When a concept needs to refer to an entity managed by another concept (e.g., a `Comment` referring to a `User` or `Target`), it only holds the generic `ID` of that entity. It cannot assume any specific properties, methods, or internal structure of these external types. This means concepts only interact with external entities by their unique identifiers, effectively decoupling their internal data models and behaviors.

3. **Complete Encapsulation of a Behavioral Concern:** Each concept is responsible for embodying *all* the functionality associated with a single, well-defined behavioral concern. It should be behaviorally complete on its own, without relying on other concepts to execute its primary purpose. For instance, the `Labeling` concept includes all actions for creating labels, adding them to items, and querying labeled items; it doesn't distribute these responsibilities across an `Item` object or a separate `Label` object.

4. **Self-Contained State Management:** Each concept defines and manages its own distinct slice of the system's state. While multiple concepts might refer to the *same* generic entity type (like `User`), they each store only the properties of that entity relevant to *their specific concern*. For example, a `UserAuthentication` concept might store a `User`'s `username` and `password`, while a `UserProfile` concept might store the *same `User`'s* `bio` and `thumbnail`. These are treated as independent views, and one concept's state modifications do not directly affect another's, even if they pertain to the same logical entity.

5. **Actions and Queries Operate Within Boundaries:** All `actions` and `queries` defined within a concept are strictly limited to mutating or reading *its own* defined state, or processing its generic input parameters. They cannot directly call actions or queries of other concepts, nor can they directly modify the state managed by another concept.

By adhering to these rules, concepts become truly independent, highly modular, reusable, and resilient to changes in other parts of the system.
