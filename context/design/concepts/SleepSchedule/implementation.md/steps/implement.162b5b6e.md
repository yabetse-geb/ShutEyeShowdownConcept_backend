# implement: SleepSchedule

Here's the implementation for the `SleepSchedule` concept, following the provided guidelines and addressing the observed ambiguities in the specification.

**Assumptions & Corrections Made During Implementation:**

1. **`addSleepSlot` Parameters:** The original spec had `addSleepSlot (u: User, bedTime:String , wakeTime: String, Time: Number): (survey: Survey)`.
   * I've assumed `Time: Number` was a typo and should have been `date: String`, aligning with other actions.
   * I've assumed `(survey: Survey)` was a typo for the return type and instead return `{ sleepSlotId: ID }` on success, or `{ error: string }` on failure, to comply with the non-empty return dictionary rule when an error path exists.
2. **`bedTime` and `wakeUpTime` in State:** Renamed to `bedTimeGoal` and `wakeUpTimeGoal` in the `SleepSlot` interface for clarity, as they represent the *target* times set by the user.
3. **`reportBedTime` and `reportWakeUpTime` Return Type:** The spec said `Boolean`. I've implemented this as `Promise<{ bedTimeSuccess: boolean } | { error: string }>` and `Promise<{ wakeUpSuccess: boolean } | { error: string }>` respectively, to return a non-empty dictionary on success when an error path is present.
4. **Time/Date Representation:** Used `string` for `DateString` (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD") and `TimeString` (e.g., "HH:MM"), and relied on lexicographical string comparison for `reportedTime <= bedTimeGoal` and `reportedTime >= wakeUpTimeGoal`. This works for 24-hour time.
5. **Adherence Logic:**
   * `bedTimeSuccess`: `reportedTime <= bedTimeGoal` (went to bed on or before target).
   * `wakeUpSuccess`: `reportedTime >= wakeUpTimeGoal` (woke up on or after target).
6. **`_id` for SleepSlot:** Each `SleepSlot` gets a `freshID()` for its `_id`, in addition to `user` and `date` which form a natural unique key for lookups.
