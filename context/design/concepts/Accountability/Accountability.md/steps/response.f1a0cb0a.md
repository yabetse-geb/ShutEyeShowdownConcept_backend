# response:

Here's an updated version of the `Accountability` concept, incorporating more detailed behavior for recording failures and generating notifications, while strictly adhering to the principles of concept design (independence, generic parameters, user-relevant purpose).

The key changes include:

1. **Generic Type Parameter for FailureID**: Making `FailureID` a generic parameter means the concept doesn't care about the internal structure or generation mechanism of failure identifiers, only that they can be used for unique identification.
2. **Refined Purpose and Principle**: The concept's purpose is now explicitly about *generating notification requests* for partners, rather than directly sending notifications (which would imply knowledge of specific communication channels like email). This keeps the concept independent and generic.
3. **`recordFailure` Action**: A new action is introduced for an external system or user to log a specific adherence failure, ensuring each failure has a unique ID.
4. **`system` Action for Notification Generation**: A new `system` action, `generateAndLogNotifications`, automatically identifies un-notified failures, determines the relevant partners, and produces a set of generic notification requests. This action also updates the concept's state to prevent duplicate notifications for the same failure-partner pair.

This design elevates the concept from a mere data structure to an active component that orchestrates a specific behavioral concern: tracking accountability failure notifications.

***

* **concept** Accountability \[User, FailureID]

* **purpose** Facilitate informing designated accountability partners about recorded adherence failures of a user for a specific date, by generating notification requests for those partners that can be processed by an external service.

* **principle** After a user designates a partner, whenever an adherence failure is recorded for a date, the system will identify all relevant partners and generate a distinct, traceable notification request for each, containing details of the failure. These requests are then available for an external notification service to consume and deliver.

* **state**
  * a set of Partnerships with
    * a user: User
    * a partner: User
  * a set of AdherenceFailures with
    * an id: FailureID (a unique identifier for each distinct failure record)
    * a failingUser: User
    * a date: Date
    * a timestamp: Timestamp (when the failure was recorded)
  * a set of NotificationsSent with
    * a failureId: FailureID (references an `AdherenceFailure`)
    * a partner: User (the specific partner for whom the notification was generated)
    * a timestamp: Timestamp (when this specific notification request was generated)

* **actions**
  * addPartner(user: User, partner: User)
    * **requires**: `user != partner` and `(user, partner)` is not in `Partnerships`
    * **effects**: Add `(user, partner)` to `Partnerships`

  * removePartner(user: User, partner: User)
    * **requires**: `(user, partner)` is in `Partnerships`
    * **effects**: Remove `(user, partner)` from `Partnerships`

  * recordFailure(failingUser: User, date: Date): (failureId: FailureID)
    * **requires**: `failingUser` is a valid `User` identifier
    * **effects**:
      * Generate a `newID` of type `FailureID` (globally unique).
      * Add a new `AdherenceFailure` `(id: newID, failingUser, date, timestamp: currentTime())` to `AdherenceFailures`.
      * Return `newID`.

  * **system** generateAndLogNotifications (): (notifications: set of {recipient: User, message: String, failureDetails: {id: FailureID, failingUser: User, date: Date}})
    * **requires**: There exists at least one `failure` in `AdherenceFailures` and at least one `partnership` in `Partnerships` such that:
      `failure.failingUser == partnership.user` AND `(failure.id, partnership.partner)` is NOT in `NotificationsSent`.
    * **effects**:
      * Initialize an empty set `generatedNotifications`.
      * For each `failure` in `AdherenceFailures`:
        * For each `partnership` in `Partnerships` where `partnership.user == failure.failingUser`:
          * Let `partner = partnership.partner`.
          * If `(failure.id, partner)` is NOT in `NotificationsSent`:
            * Add `(failure.id, partner, currentTime())` to `NotificationsSent`.
            * Construct a generic notification message, e.g., `msg = "Your accountability partner ${failure.failingUser} recorded an adherence failure on ${failure.date}."`
            * Add `{recipient: partner, message: msg, failureDetails: {id: failure.id, failingUser: failure.failingUser, date: failure.date}}` to `generatedNotifications`.
      * Return the `generatedNotifications` set.
