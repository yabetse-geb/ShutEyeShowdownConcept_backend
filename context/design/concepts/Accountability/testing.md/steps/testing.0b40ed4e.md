# testing: Accountability concept by testing the operational principle and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Ensure that every action is executed successfully in at least one scenario. For the 3-5 additional interesting scenarios include these scenarios: 1. **Frequency Transition (Immediate → Daily → Weekly):** Add a partner, set to Immediate and test same-day alerts (no repeats), then switch to Daily and test yesterday’s unreported failures, then switch to Weekly and ensure only unreported failures from the past 7 days appear, with correct lastReportDate updates and no duplicates., 2.**Empty vs. Non-Empty Reporting:** Record a failure, then call reportAllFailuresFromStartToEnd first for a date range with no failures, then for a range that includes the failure (expect message list). 3. **Weekly Reporting Skipping Period** in the Accountability concept. The goal is to verify that weekly report generation correctly includes only unreported failures from the last seven days and excludes those already reported. In this scenario, record adherence failures for a single user across 10 consecutive days. Then, call `generateNotificationMessage` on day 7, which should generate a weekly report including failures from days 1–7 and mark them as reported. Afterward, call `generateNotificationMessage` again on day 10. This second report should only include unreported failures from days 8–10, not repeat previously reported ones, and it should update `lastReportDate` correctly.
