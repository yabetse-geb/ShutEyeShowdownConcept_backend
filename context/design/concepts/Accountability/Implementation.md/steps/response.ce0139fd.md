To ensure your concepts are independent, you must adhere to the core principles of Concept Design as outlined in the provided background material. These principles fundamentally drive separation of concerns and minimize coupling.

Here's how to make sure your concepts are independent:

1. **Enforce Absolute Independence of Dependencies and State:**
   * **No Direct References to Other Concepts:** A concept should never directly import, reference, or instantiate another concept class. This is a strict rule in implementation (`No import statements can reference another concept in any way, including type declarations`).
   * **Self-Contained State:** Each concept maintains its *own* distinct state, entirely dedicated to fulfilling its single purpose. It should not directly access or modify the internal state managed by another concept. In a database context, this is enforced by using uniquely prefixed collection names for each concept's state components (e.g., `Accountability.partnerships`, `Accountability.adherenceFailures`). This prevents inadvertent data coupling.
   * **Separation of Concerns and Different Views:** Concepts explicitly separate concerns. Instead of an object having a single global definition (as in OO), a concept provides a "view" or a set of properties and behaviors related to a specific concern. For example, `UserAuthentication` handles `username` and `password`, while `UserProfile` handles `bio` and `thumbnail` for the *same* generic `User` entity. Neither concept knows about the other's state components for that `User`.

2. **Work Off Generic Parameters (Polymorphism):**
   * Concepts use generic type parameters (e.g., `User`, `Target`, `Item`).
   * These generic parameters must be treated as **completely polymorphic and opaque identifiers**. The concept cannot assume they have any specific properties or methods. It can only compare them to determine if two instances represent the same object (like comparing `ID`s). This forces loose coupling because the concept has no inherent knowledge of the underlying concrete type or its attributes managed by other concepts.

3. **Maintain a Single, User-Relevant Purpose:**
   * **Focused Purpose:** Each concept must have a single, clearly defined, user-centric purpose. This narrowly defined scope inherently limits the data it manages and the functionality it provides, preventing it from becoming a monolithic entity that implicitly intertwines with other parts of the system.
   * **Behavioral Completeness:** A concept must embody *all* the functionality (actions and queries) associated with its specific behavioral concern. It should not depend on other concepts to complete its core purpose. If an action's `effects` imply a change that falls outside the concept's single purpose, it indicates a dependency or an over-reach.

4. **Communicate Via Simple, Primitive-Based Data Structures:**
   * Actions and queries communicate using generic dictionary objects (JSON objects) containing primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans) or generic `ID`s.
   * They **must not** pass custom objects that might represent or imply the internal structure of another concept. This avoids creating implicit structural dependencies between concepts.

By rigorously adhering to these rules throughout the design and implementation phases, you ensure that your concepts are truly independent, modular, easily testable in isolation, and can be composed flexibly without creating brittle, tightly coupled systems.
