To ensure your concepts are independent, you must adhere strictly to the core tenets of Concept Design as outlined in the provided background material. These principles are fundamental to achieving low coupling and high cohesion within your software architecture.

Here's how to make sure your concepts are independent:

1. **Enforce Absolute Independence of Dependencies and State:**
   * **No Direct References to Other Concepts:** This is a paramount rule. A concept must not directly import, reference, or instantiate another concept class in its code. This prevents direct code-level coupling.
   * **Self-Contained State:** Each concept must manage its *own* independent state, dedicated solely to its single purpose. It should never directly access or modify the internal state data managed by another concept. In practical implementations (like with MongoDB), this is achieved by using uniquely prefixed collection names for each concept's state components (e.g., `Accountability.partnerships`, `Accountability.adherenceFailures`). This prevents state clashes and implicit data dependencies.
   * **Separation of Concerns and Different Views:** Concepts explicitly promote separation of concerns. Instead of a single "object" having all its properties aggregated, different concepts can manage different aspects (or "views") of the same generic entity. For instance, a `UserAuthentication` concept manages a `User`'s `username` and `password`, while a `UserProfile` concept manages the *same* `User`'s `bio` and `thumbnail`. Neither concept needs to know the internal structure or specific properties of the `User` that the other concept manages; they only operate on the generic `User` ID.

2. **Work Off Generic Parameters (Polymorphism):**
   * Concepts must define and operate on generic type parameters (e.g., `User`, `Item`, `Target`).
   * These generic parameters are treated as **completely polymorphic and opaque identifiers (`ID`s)**. The concept cannot assume they have any specific properties, methods, or internal structure. It can only compare them for equality to determine if two instances refer to the same object. This forces a high degree of loose coupling, as the concept remains ignorant of the concrete types or their attributes that might be managed by other parts of the system.

3. **Maintain a Single, User-Relevant Purpose:**
   * **Focused Purpose:** Each concept must have a single, clearly defined, user-centric purpose. This narrowly defined scope naturally limits the data it manages and the specific functionality it provides. A well-defined purpose prevents the concept from becoming a monolithic entity that aggregates unrelated responsibilities and thus implicitly intertwines with other parts of the system.
   * **Behavioral Completeness:** A concept must embody *all* the functionality (actions and queries) required to fulfill its specific behavioral concern. It should be "behaviorally complete" for its purpose, meaning it doesn't need to depend on other concepts to complete its core tasks. If an action's `effects` logically extend beyond the concept's single purpose, it often indicates an over-reach or a hidden dependency.

4. **Communicate Via Simple, Primitive-Based Data Structures:**
   * Actions and queries must communicate using simple, generic dictionary/JSON objects. These objects should primarily contain primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans) or generic `ID`s.
   * They **must not** pass custom objects that might represent or imply the internal structure or specific types managed by another concept. This avoids creating implicit structural dependencies and ensures that the interface between concepts remains generic and stable.

By rigorously adhering to these rules during both the design and implementation phases, you build a system where concepts are truly modular, testable in isolation, and can be composed flexibly without creating brittle, tightly coupled dependencies that hinder maintainability and extensibility.
