# response:

To ensure concepts are independent, adherence to the core tenets of Concept Design is paramount. These tenets are explicitly stated in the "Concept Design Background" and "Concepts are not objects" sections of the provided document:

1. **Isolation of Dependencies and State:**
   * **No Direct Imports:** Concepts must not import or reference other concept classes. This prevents direct code-level coupling.
   * **Self-Contained State:** Each concept maintains its own independent state, entirely dedicated to its single purpose. In an implementation context like MongoDB, this is achieved by using uniquely prefixed collection names for each concept's state components (e.g., `Accountability.partnerships`, `Accountability.adherenceFailures`). This ensures that one concept cannot directly access or manipulate the internal state data managed by another concept.

2. **Generic Parameters and Polymorphism:**
   * **Opaque IDs:** Concepts operate solely on generic type parameters (like `User`, `Item`, `Target`), which are treated as opaque identifiers (e.g., `ID` type). They cannot assume any specific properties, methods, or internal structure of these types beyond the ability to compare them for equality. This forces concepts to be highly polymorphic and decoupled from concrete data types managed elsewhere.

3. **Single, User-Relevant Purpose and Separation of Concerns:**
   * **Focused Purpose:** Each concept has a single, clearly defined, user-centric purpose. This narrowly defined scope naturally limits what data and functionality the concept should manage, preventing it from becoming a monolithic entity that aggregates responsibilities belonging to other parts of the system.
   * **Encapsulated Functionality:** A concept must embody all the functionality (actions and queries) required to fulfill its specific behavioral concern. It should not rely on other concepts to complete its core purpose. This "behavioral completeness" reinforces its independence.
   * **Communication via Primitives:** Actions and queries communicate using simple, generic dictionary objects containing primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans, or generic `ID`s). This avoids passing complex custom objects that might imply knowledge of, or dependencies on, other concepts' internal data structures.

By strictly adhering to these principles during design and implementation, concepts remain modular, testable in isolation, and can be composed flexibly without creating tight, brittle dependencies that would undermine software maintainability and extensibility.
