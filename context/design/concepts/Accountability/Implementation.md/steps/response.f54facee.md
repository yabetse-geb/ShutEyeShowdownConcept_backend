# response:

Here's an updated version of the `Accountability` concept that includes more interesting behavior, addressing the initial concern that it was "essentially nothing more than a data structure."

The key changes involve:

1. **Refined Purpose and Principle**: To accurately reflect the concept's generic nature and its role in *generating* notifications rather than *sending* them directly (which would involve specific types like email).
2. **Extended State**: To track adherence failures and which partners have been notified for those failures.
3. **New Actions**:
   * `recordFailure`: To log when a user fails to meet their schedule.
   * `generateAndLogNotifications` (a system action): To automatically detect un-notified failures, identify relevant partners, mark them as notified, and output a set of generic notification requests that an external service could then process (e.g., send as emails).

***

```
* **concept** Accountability [User, FailureID]
* **purpose** Facilitate informing designated accountability partners about recorded adherence failures of a user for a specific date, by generating notification requests for those partners.
* **principle** After a user designates a partner, whenever an adherence failure is recorded for a date, the system generates a distinct notification request for that partner containing details of the failure. This request can then be consumed and delivered by an external notification service.
* **state**
  * a set of Partnerships with
    * a user: User
    * a partner: User
  * a set of AdherenceFailures with
    * an id: FailureID (a unique identifier for each distinct failure record)
    * a failingUser: User
    * a date: Date
  * a set of NotificationsSent with
    * a failureId: FailureID (references an `AdherenceFailure`)
    * a partner: User (the specific partner for whom the notification was generated)
    * a timestamp: Timestamp (when this specific notification was generated)
* **actions**
  * addPartner(user: User, partner: User)
    * **requires**: `user != partner` and `(user, partner)` is not in `Partnerships`
    * **effects**: Add `(user, partner)` to `Partnerships`
  * removePartner(user: User, partner: User)
    * **requires**: `(user, partner)` is in `Partnerships`
    * **effects**: Remove `(user, partner)` from `Partnerships`
  * recordFailure(failingUser: User, date: Date): (failureId: FailureID)
    * **requires**: `failingUser` is a valid User and `date` is a valid Date (e.g., in the past, or current day)
    * **effects**:
      * Generate a `newID` for the failure.
      * Add a new `AdherenceFailure` `(id: newID, failingUser, date)` to `AdherenceFailures`.
      * Return `newID`.
  * **system** generateAndLogNotifications (): (notifications: set of {recipient: User, message: String, failureDetails: {failingUser: User, date: Date}})
    * **requires**: There exists at least one `failure` in `AdherenceFailures` and at least one `partnership` in `Partnerships` such that:
                  `failure.failingUser == partnership.user` AND `(failure.id, partnership.partner)` is NOT in `NotificationsSent`.
    * **effects**:
      * Initialize an empty set `generatedNotifications`.
      * For each `failure` in `AdherenceFailures`:
        * For each `partnership` in `Partnerships` where `partnership.user == failure.failingUser`:
          * Let `partner = partnership.partner`.
          * If `(failure.id, partner)` is NOT in `NotificationsSent`:
            * Add `(failure.id, partner, currentTime)` to `NotificationsSent`.
            * Construct a notification message, e.g., `msg = "Your accountability partner ${failure.failingUser} recorded an adherence failure on ${failure.date}."`
            * Add `{recipient: partner, message: msg, failureDetails: {failingUser: failure.failingUser, date: failure.date}}` to `generatedNotifications`.
      * Return the `generatedNotifications` set.
