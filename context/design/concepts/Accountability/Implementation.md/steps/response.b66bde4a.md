# response:

To ensure concepts are independent, the key principles highlighted in the "Concept Design Background" are crucial:

1. **No direct dependencies on other concepts:** A concept should not import, reference, or directly interact with the internal state or specific methods of another concept class. It should manage its own state and provide its own complete set of actions and queries for its single purpose.
2. **Generic Parameters:** Concepts must work off generic parameters (e.g., `User`, `Item`, `Target` as `ID`s). They cannot assume specific properties or internal structures of these types. They only treat them as opaque identifiers that can be compared for equality. This forces loose coupling.
3. **Clear, User-Relevant Purpose & Encapsulated State:** Each concept has a single, well-defined, user-centric purpose. Its state should be entirely dedicated to fulfilling this purpose, avoiding aggregation of data that belongs to other concerns. This "separation of concerns" prevents a single concept from becoming a monolithic entity that implicitly depends on, or dictates, the behavior of other parts of the system.

In practice, for the TypeScript implementation guidelines provided:

* **No `import` statements referencing another concept class.**
* **State is prefixed** with the concept name (e.g., `Accountability.partnerships`, `Accountability.adherenceFailures`) to ensure unique collection names in the shared database, preventing direct state clashes.
* **Generic IDs (`ID` type)** are used for external entities, enforcing polymorphism and preventing type-specific assumptions.
* **Methods return generic dictionary objects or errors**, rather than custom concept-specific objects from other concepts.

By adhering strictly to these rules, concepts remain self-contained, testable in isolation, and can be composed flexibly without creating tight, brittle dependencies.
