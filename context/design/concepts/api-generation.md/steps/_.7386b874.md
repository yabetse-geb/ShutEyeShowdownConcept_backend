# Concept Design Background

Concept design organizes software into concepts, which are independent and familiar units of functionality with a single purpose. A concept specification contains:

* **concept**: a descriptive name balancing generality of use and appropriate specificity
* **purpose**: the reason for why this concept exists, and what it enables
* **principle**: a motivating scenario that establishes how the concept achieves its purpose
* **state**: a simple state modeling language meant to capture the basic relationships between the necessary information
* **actions**: a set of events that (largely) mutate the state or update represented information, written as a set of pre/postconditions: what the action **requires** in order to occur, and what **effects** it has

Concepts are uniquely motivated by the fact that they are:

1. Completely independent of one another in terms of dependencies and state.
2. Work off generic parameters, and cannot know about specific types.
3. Strongly grounded in a user-relevant purpose, and not just a structure for software.
