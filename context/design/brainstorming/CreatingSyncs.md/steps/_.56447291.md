# Create Synchronizations

I am creating an which allows users to set up sleep schedules, like their bedtimes and wakeup times each day along with a minute tolerance so if they go to sleep/wake up within x minutes before or after their bedtime/wake up time it is counted as a success otherwise it is considered a failure. Users can also set up competitions in which they're successes will add 1 to their scores, their failures will not increment or decrement their scores, and failure to report sleep events before the end of a competition will lead to decrementing their scores by 1 for each missed reported sleep event. Users also can add accountability partners, in which their failures will be reported to their accountability partners.
