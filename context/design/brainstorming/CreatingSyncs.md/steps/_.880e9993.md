# Requesting Routes

Any routes that you **exclude** or do not match a passthrough route will automatically fire a `Request.request` action, and if you've left the default logging setting to `TRACE`, you'll see a recorded trace of this action such as:

```
Requesting.request {
  scaleMin: 1,
  scaleMax: 5,
  author: 'me',
  title: 'Mangos',
  path: '/LikertSurvey/createSurvey'
} => { request: '019a22d2-e44d-7f79-be62-92ead8db2d77' }
```

This allows you to synchronize against `Requesting.request` to fire off any other concept actions, and eventually respond with something along the lines of:

```
Requesting.respond {
  request: '019a22d2-e44d-7f79-be62-92ead8db2d77',
  survey: '019a22d2-e485-71b4-a668-e7d9e8859b15'
} => { request: '019a22d2-e44d-7f79-be62-92ead8db2d77' }
```

**Important:** Both `Requesting.request` and `Requesting.respond` take *any* parameters as a flat list alongside `path:` and `request:`, meaning in order to call this `Requesting.respond`, you simply have the following `then` clause:

```sync
then
  Requesting.respond (request, survey)
```

or in TypeScript,

```typescript
{
  //...
  then: actions([Requesting.respond, { request, survey }])
}
```

See [sample.sync](src/syncs/sample.sync.ts) for example synchronizations that implement a basic request/response cycle that mimics a passthrough route for the `/LikertSurvey/createSurvey` path.

> **Important**: the `path` parameter does NOT take into account the base URL, and hence the examples above use "/LikertSurvey/createSurvey" instead of "/api/LikertSurvey/createSurvey". You should take this into account when pattern matching in synchronizations against literal values for the path.
